# Introduction

>script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

> designing the script like design ahome step by step

>**_Vocabulary:_** The words that computers understand.

>**_Syntax:_** How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow.

>**_debugging:_** discover what might have gone wrong.

>Computers solve problems programmatically; they follow series of instructions, one after another. The type of instructions they need are often different to
the type of instructions you might give to another human.

>A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

>Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

>Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

>To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

## EXPRESSIONS

**There are two types of expressions:**

>*EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE:*
var color = 'beige';

>_EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE:_
var area = 3 * 2;

## OPERATORS:

**they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.**

>ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS : like color = 'beige';

>COMPARISON OPERATORS : like color = 'beige';

>ARITHMETIC OPERATORS : like area = 3 * 2;

>LOGICAL OPERATORS : like buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

>STRING OPERATORS : like greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';

# FUNCTIONS

>**Functions :** group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

>**calling:** when you want to ask function to do his task.

>**parameters:** pieces of information passed to function.

>**return value:** the answer when you call the function.

>the functions written like this:
function updateMessage () {}

![func](https://tutorial.techaltum.com/images/javascript-functions.jpg)

>_function declaration:_ is a statement containing a function prototype (function name, return type, the types of parameters and their order).

>_Calling Function:_ excute all of the statments between its curly braces with just one line of code.

sayHello();
## example:
**You can call this function like this :**
