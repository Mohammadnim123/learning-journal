# Text editor
**At the first you can’t work on web development without text editor beside that there are many of text editors so you can take the best for you, the all of text editors are same with small different just search on Google about it and take the text editor can complete your work:**

_Now the question is what is the text editor?_

**A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.**

*The next question is what we can do by the text editors?*

>1.) Code completion.
 
 >2.) Syntax highlighting.

>3.) A nice variety of themes.

>4.) The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

>5.) Ability to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently and other languages.

**Please make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer because there are a different between text editor for windows and mac and Linux Also, please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names.**

**Now I will mention some of text editors and make compression:**

**The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title — it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does.**

# The Command Line!

**Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX.**

 >_terminal:_ is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard.

 >_shell:_ This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you the most common one is called bash.

 >_shortcut:_ make your life easier.

 # Basic Navigation!

 >pwd: Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
ls : List the contents of a directory.
cd : Change Directories - ie. move to another director

>_Relative path:_ A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
_Absolute path :_ A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.


# More About Files!

>Everything is a file under Linux Even directories.
>Linux is an extensionless system Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
