> Equal to (==): compare two value if thay are same value.

>not Equal to (!=): compare two value if thay are not same value.

>STRICT Equal to (===): compare two da value if thay are same value and data type.

>STRICT NOT Equal to (!==): compare two da value if thay are not same value and data type.

>GREATER THAN (>): chick the number on the left greater than on  the right.

>LESS THAN (<): chick the number on the right less than on  the left.

# LOOPS

Loops : commands can can execute a block of code a number of times and there are two type of it.

![loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/images/for_loop.jpg)

>for - loops through a block of code a number of times

>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

**This is the structure of the for loop :**
![for](https://www.sitesbay.com/cpp/images/control-statement/for-loop-steps.png)

>the for loop will stop if the condition give false.

**And this is the structure for While loop :**
