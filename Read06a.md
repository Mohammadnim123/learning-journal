# CH-1
# JavaScript & HTML
**Each language forms a separate
layer with a different purpose.
Each layer, from left to right,
builds on the previous one.**

>HTML : CONTENT LAYER
>CSS : PRESENTATION LAYER
>JavaScript : BEHAVIOR LAYER

>It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the js extension.

>The HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the (link) element can be used to load a CSS file).

>If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the  HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.

# CH-2

>A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.


>Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

>Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

>Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information .

>JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

>Expressions evaluate into a single value.Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value .
