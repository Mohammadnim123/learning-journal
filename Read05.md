**we can add design and the colors using css to our pages and You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways :**

>_Rgb Values_ : These express colors.

>_Hex Codes_ : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color.

>_Color Names_ : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color.

>_HSLA_ : Mentioned Later.

**Now we learn css colors codes :**

>_background-color:_ You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names
(covered on the next page).

>_opacity, rgba :_ CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.

>**_hsl, hsla :_**
_hue:_
This is expressed as an angle
(between 0 and 360 degrees).
_saturation:_
This is expressed as a
percentage.
_lightness:_
This is expressed as a
percentage with 0% being white,
50% being normal, and 100%
being black.

>It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

>CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

>Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

>Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

>Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

>CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
